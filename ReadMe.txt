Net Usage Moniter-ReadMe
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	This application calculates the time connected to the net and finds out the total amount spend by surfing the net. The cost is calculated as per the pulse. If 180 is the pulse then even if you connect for 1 second the cost of 180 second is added.Thus a correct amout spend is found out.
	It also uses DD7 to display the session details after you disconnect from the net and also a log file.
	When you move the mouse near the tray the time you are connected to the net is poped up. You can also disable this popup.

	The code is well commented-each and every line. You can learn the following things from this code.

*Check for internet connection
*Read and write from registry
*Keeping log files
*Display text directly to the screen
*Add details of a file to textbox
*Add, Delete,Modify the tray icon
*Read from resource file
*Slide down opening of form as given by Scrolling Notice http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?lngWId=1&txtCodeId=14911

	The program is not tested on NT and is not for it. I think changes are needed in api call,then you have to get OSversion etc, to make it work there and here in 98. I created this for my personal use and me and my friends dont have NT to test the other part. Enjoy learning new thing.
	This actually took me almost 3 days completely, more time to comment than to design. So give me a fair evaluation friends. See you all again.


A small request note: 
	If you are not a very busy person, don't forget to give me a postcard of your place(or a stamp or a coin.) or a photo of your country side.  It's my hobby to collect stamps, coins and photos of different place/countries. The email killed the snailmail but I love to have them going so that I am not bored by 'outlooks'.An advance Thanks.

	I do hope that you have already given 5 globes for my effort.Thank you for that.Please vote(if you have not, before connection is cut)and encourage me to submit further beautiful codes.

    Also do visit http://ajsoftware.freeserver.com/index. It contains an activex counter,developed by me. Sometimes there will be some warning messages.If u need its source code don't forget to mail me.
